## Question 03
Real-time complex AM. Implement real-time complex AM in Python with PyAudio. Your pro- gram should take the microphone signal as input and produce an output audio signal (on speakers or headphones). **Compare the sound with real-valued AM in equation (1) which was implemented earlier in the course.** To avoid feedback issues and to hear the signals clearly, it is recommended to use headphones or earbuds to compare the audio of the two methods.

**Solution:**

It appears that the output of complex AM is somewhat more clearer in headphones than previous class' AM output. Therefore, it has less noise than normal AM.
