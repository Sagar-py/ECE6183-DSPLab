## Question 04
The past demo program play_vibrato_interpolation.py does not use blocking (it reads and writes one sample at a time). Write a version of this program that reads, processes, and writes the audio signal in blocks of 64 frames. Verify that the output signal of the new version (using block processing) is the same.

**Observation:**

It was observed that on implementing block processing on the previous vibrato demo program, the output observed was the same.
