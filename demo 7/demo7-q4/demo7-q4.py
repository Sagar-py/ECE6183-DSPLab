## 	demo 07

# 	Question 04:
#	Modify the demo program mic_filter.py to process the input 
#	signal x(t) so that the output signal is: y(t) = x(t) cos(2Ï€f0t)
#	where f0 = 400 Hz. This is amplitude modulation. The 
#	output signal y(t) should both be played to the speaker 
#	(or headphones) and saved to a wave file. What is the effect 
#	of this on the voice signal? Submit your wave (wav) file of 
#	yourself talking, as well as your code.
